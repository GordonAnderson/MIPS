MIPS produces DC and RF voltages designed for mass spectrometry applications. The MIPS system is controlled by a powerful ARM embedded controller running at a clock frequency of 84 MHz. This processor controls the output voltages as well as monitors the outputs to ensure proper operation. Digital I/O is provided as well as the ability to generate complex pulse sequences for advanced control applications.

MIPS provides a USB interface to a host computer, and through this interface, you can control and monitor all the MIPS modules. 

MIPS systems are built using a MIPS controller and a number of additional
modules to generate the RF and DC voltages your application needs. The MIPS
controller is required for every MIPS system. This controller communicates
with the modules and provides a user interface as well as an interface to 
a host computer.

The hardware folder has the schematics and parts list as well as Eagle CAD
design files.
